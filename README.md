# Pizza Bot

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

The task this week was to use JavaScript to make a pizza ordering site which would take information supplied by the user and store it in variables
which could then be displayed back to the user using functions and conditional statements.

## The problem

After we had completed the original iterations, we used .innerHTML and template literals to display messages on the webpage as opposed to in the console or with alert windows. We used a few different type of inputs: text, radio buttons, and a range slider, and used .value to store them into variables. We also created a new function which contained a conditional statement that would add an extra hundred kronor to the overall cost if a certain radio button was clicked.
